### Brainstorming:
Website starting, progressive web app
Acronym translation - shows that itâ€™s not a death sentence 


Bot for a case worker to help direct a person in need towards the right care
Target case: [Downtown Needle Exchange](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Downtown+Needle+Exchange/@47.6147226,-122.3433921,18.1z/data=!4m9!1m2!2m1!1sthe+needle+exchange!3m5!1s0x5490154c742583c7:0x61a72169b6eee79e!8m2!3d47.6145878!4d-122.3421586!15sChN0aGUgbmVlZGxlIGV4Y2hhbmdlWhUiE3RoZSBuZWVkbGUgZXhjaGFuZ2WSAQ5tZWRpY2FsX2NsaW5pY5oBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOVmQwNXRabGwzRUFF4AEA) ([Medical Office](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health.aspx))

### Solutions to Provide:
Case worker encounters things outside of their medical expertise - where can they direct the client?
1. Create a working file for end patient to bring from case worker to doctor and back
- No identifying features
- Symptoms, etc, allow writing down information that the end patient may not know how to utilize
Form that is filled out with help of AI bot that can be emailed to patient.

2. Case worker helps patient prepare for doctor appointment by pulling important information that the end patient may not know what to share

3. Patient takes notes file to doctor's office for medical use

4. Case worker has ability to find more information about diagnosis - would need information from Doctor 
5. Follow up form for concerns from patient

## Concerns
- HIPAA
- Security
- Understanding medical concerns - what the acronym means, and what the diagnoses means for life changes
- Increase Patient's understanding of medical diagnoses


## Next Steps:
- Identify MVP - Step 1
- Flush out step 1 
    - what fields do we need?
    - Can the bot help compile a document?
    - What format is the desired outcome? PDF, txt, paper, etc.
- Find connection between case worker and doctor. Are case workers able to communicate directly with a case's doctor?
